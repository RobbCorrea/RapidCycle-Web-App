## Rapid Cycle Web App

Do you separate your trash into waste and scraps?<br />
RapidCycle helps you find a recycler close to you.<br />
If you've already enjoyed the benefits of our <br />
mobile app RapidCycle, this brand new web app<br />
is just the thing for you!<br />

### Our history
In 2018 the Eye in the Sky Technologies development<br />
team launched an Android-based mobile app called<br />
RapidCycle which allows you to properly dispose<br />
of your wastes by loggin in, pressing a button,<br />
and waiting for a driver to pick up your <br />
scraps and garbage. <br />
<br />
The driver may visually assess the overall worth<br />
(it is always more if you properly separate your <br />
trash) of valuable scraps in your wastes <br />
-like metals, clean plastics and such-,<br />
and pay for them accordingly!<br />
<br />
"It's free, it's fast, it's clean.", is our<br />
motto.
<br />
RapidCycle has and will always be free to use<br />
for homeowners. But for those business owners<br />
who lay their trust on our team's shoulders<br />
in order to find better and faster<br />
recycling routes, for their<br />
driver fleets, we launch<br />
RapidCycle Web App.<br />
<br />

### That's all good but, what does it do?

RapidCycle Webb App (RC for our pals) is a MERN<br />
based Application for browsers that allows<br />
current Collectors (or recycling business<br />
owners) keep track of their staff, their<br />
driving personnel, aswell as keeping<br />
an online presence for the service<br />
they already provide at no further<br />
expense.<br />

This first version of RapidCycle allows<br />
Collectors to activate and deactivate<br />
different menu tags in order to<br />
display on their RC Web App<br />
whatever information seems<br />
crucial to them.<br />

They may also register new employees<br />
and grant them administrator privi-<br />
ledges so that they may rely on<br />
someone to keep their web space<br />
cool. ;)<br />

It comes with drag and drop functions<br />
so that editing becomes a pleasure.<br />

And it's link-related to reliable sources<br />
of material price quoting sites, so that<br />
our Collectors (or partners) may keep<br />
their customers informed and happy.<br />

Further versions will absorb all the higher<br />
functions of our mobile Android version and<br />
merge them with the RC Web Apps own goods.<br />

For now we offer this first version of<br />
RapidCycle Web App as free business<br />
added value for all our trusted<br />
partners. Enjoy!<br />
